# Automated-Carbon-Footprint-Research-Data

The data package contains experimental results conducted as part of a master’s thesis. The thesis research title is “Exploring Automated Reduction of the Carbon Footprint of Webpages” In this research, we divided the project into two parts. For the first part, we conducted the interview and survey research to investigate other developers’ opinions on carbon footprint reduction, for the second part, we developed the Automated carbon footprint reduction tool with different fitness function configurations and regard the original version and a Random generation tool as the baselines. The interview and survey data were collected after the case study, and the experimental data were collected while conducting the final experiments for the tool.
